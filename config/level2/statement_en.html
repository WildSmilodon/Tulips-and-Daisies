      <span>Expert Rules</span>
    </h1>
    <div class="statement-expert-rules-content">
	
	
	<h2>Details</h2>
	    <ul>
		  <li>After harvest, grass is found on the tiles.</li>
          <li>The field has <var>fieldHeight</var> rows and <var>fieldWidth</var> columns.</li>
          <li>The top-left corner has position (0,0).</li>
          <li><var>col</var> goes to the right, <var>row</var> increases downwards.</li>
          <li>Each turn you specify where you want to plant your flower by giving <var>row</var> and <var>col</var>. </li>
        </ul>
	
	<h2>Planting costs</h2>
	<p>
	It is allowed to plant your flower anywhere within the field. However, there is a cost associated with planting, which depends on the state of the tile, you want to plant in.
	The cost is deducted from your gold stockpile before planting the flower. You lose, if you do not have enough gold.
	Planting on soil is free, on grass it costs <const>1</const> gold, on rocks <const>5</const> gold and on opponents flower <const>10</const> gold.
	The following table presents the costs of planting your flower on different tiles graphically:

	</p>
	
	<h2>Harvesting flowers</h2>
	<p>
	The flowers are harvested according to the following algorithm. 
	<code>	
        <ul>
          <li>for each direction (horizontal, vertical, both diagonals)
		   	<ul>
          		<li>count the number of adjacent flowers starting from the flower just planted in both ways</li>
		  		<li>if the number of adjacent flowers in this direction is larger or equal to <const>4</const>, all adjacent flowers in this direction are harvested.</li>		  
        	</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
	</code>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Earning gold</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
    	<li>The gold earned from <var>N</var> harvested flowers is calculated by summing the first <var>N</var> numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. </li>
		<li>Example: when harvesting <const>4</const> flowers, the player earns 1+1+2+3=<const>7</const> gold, when harvesting <const>6</const> flowers, player earns 1+1+2+3+5+8=<const>20</const> gold. </li>

      Here is an example where the Daisy player harvests 4 flowers and earns 1+1+2+3=7 gold.

Here is an example where the Tulip player plants a tulip on grass and then harvests 4 flowers and earns 1+1+2+3=7 gold. He first pays the fee for planting on grass (1 gold) and only then earns gold from harvesting, thus turning a profit of 6 gold.

        <h1>Tulips & Daisies</h1>
        <div class="story-text">
Back in the 1980s, children in school had math notebooks in which the pages were printed by a grid of squares. Ideal for playing Tic-Tac-Toe. Since playing Tic-Tac-Toe gets boing really quick, a new game was invented. It was played on the whole page of the notebook and points were scored if you got 4 in a row. The game ended when the school bell rang or when the page of the notebook was full. Tulips and daisies was inspired by this game.
